- ** Renamed to MasonX::Request::WithApacheSession.  MasonX is the new
official namespace for classes distributed outside of the Mason core
that extend Mason.

This means that when you install this release, it will not replace
HTML::Mason::Request::WithApacheSession.  Make sure you change your
usage of this class in your httpd.conf or handler.pl file!

- Get cookie (and session id) in the constructor, so that the session
is available from the request object returned by
ApacheHandler->prepare_request().  Bug report by Matthias Juchem.

- Try to use Apache::Cookie if we're running under mod_perl, but
fallback to CGI::Cookie if necessary.

- Some parameters which should have allowed undef were not allowing
it.

- When an incoming cookie contained an invalid session id and a new
session was created, the old session id was still being set in the
cookie for that request.  Reported by Warren Welch.
