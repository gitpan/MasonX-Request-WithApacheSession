HTML::Mason::Request::WithApacheSession
=======================================

This module takes advantage of the new flexibility in Mason 1.09_01
and newer to integrate an Apache::Session session directly into
Mason's Request object.

This module is very alpha at this point, considering that it only
works with a beta release of Mason!

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
